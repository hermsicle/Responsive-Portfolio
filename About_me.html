                        Hi! I’m Herman Liu, born and raised in San Francisco and I feel like I am an old soul. Sometimes
                        when I’m driving down the highway I would put some classical music and it really calms me down
                        and keeps me at ease. Firstly, I want to state that food is life, I love to eat all types of
                        foods. A childhood dream of mine was to travel around the globe and indulge in exotic foods, and
                        most importantly, get paid for doing it! Traveling has always been a hobby of mine, whether it
                        is out of state or the city, it's always fun to get out and explore! I would like to plan a trip
                        to Europe after completion of this course. I also like cars, coffee, and of course, cocaine and
                        hookers (joking...or am I?) <br>
                        <br>I recently graduated from San Francisco State University with my undergrad degree in
                        Criminal
                        Justice Studies. I’m very interested in learning web development not only for a career change
                        but I see a lot of potential in it as well! Coming from a Criminal Justice background, web
                        development is a totally new topic to me, but I want you all to know that I’m going to do my
                        best in this bootcamp, with the help of my colleagues, awesome TA’s and Professor Thomas, the
                        sky's the limit!
                    </p>
